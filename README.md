### 👨‍💻 About Me

🎯 I’m a career switcher currently enrolled in a Bachelor’s degree in IT at La Plateforme\_ (Marseille), focused on becoming a well-rounded web developer.

After more than 10 years working as a bartender, I decided to fully commit to tech — driven by curiosity, the desire to build useful digital tools, and the freedom that development offers.

💻 I’m learning fullstack development (JavaScript, Node.js, React, PHP...) and I’m particularly interested in:

- Building clean, scalable web applications
- Understanding business needs and solving real problems
- Exploring the potential of AI and cloud-based tools

🚀 I’m currently looking for a 24-month apprenticeship starting in September 2025 — open to any challenge that helps me grow and contribute to meaningful projects.

Let’s connect!
